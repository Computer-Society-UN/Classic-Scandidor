# Classic-Scandidor
This project focuses on interpreting ancient Greek texts using metrics. "Scanning" involves assigning signs to syllables to divide the text into metrical lines, distinguishing between short and long syllables. This process can be automated by creating a corpus that classifies these syllables, facilitating the interpretation of epic texts.
